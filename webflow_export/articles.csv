<p>In this article, you&#39;ll learn how to adjust a patient&#39;s paid amount to any other date of service. </p>
<h3>Step 1: Select the patient whose balance you want to adjust. To do this, go to Patients and select the desired patient.</h3>
<h3>Step 2: View the patient&#39;s profile.</h3>
<h3>Step 3: Navigate to the Billing tab on the left scroll.</h3>
<h3>Step 4: Here, you&#39;ll see all the charge IDs for that patient. If a patient payment is available or the patient has paid any amount, the Adjust Balance button will be available. However, if the charge ID is in closed status, you won&#39;t be able to move or adjust that balance to any other date of service. To adjust the balance, click on the Add this balance button.</h3>
<h3>Step 5: You&#39;ll now see all dates of services for that patient. You can adjust the balance with these dates of service.</h3>
<h3>Step 6: For instance, let&#39;s say you&#39;re adjusting from the patient&#39;s date of service on the 29th of February 2024, and for that particular charge ID, the patient has paid $310. You can adjust a partial or full amount to any date of service listed in the table.</h3>
<h3>Step 7: As an example, let&#39;s adjust $10 to this charge ID for a $100 tourist charge ID.</h3>
<h3>Step 8: Once you click out of the box, you&#39;ll see the total remaining balance, which you can adjust to any other date of services.</h3>
<h3>Step 9: Once the total amount is adjusted, you won&#39;t be able to adjust any more balances. The button will be disabled and you&#39;ll see that the remaining amount is going to credit balance.</h3>
<h3>Step 10: When you&#39;re done, click on the Adjust Balance button. The system will automatically adjust these balances to all the charge IDs for which you were adjusting the balances.</h3>
<h3>Step 11: You can track the payment details under the charge ID that you just set this balance for.</h3>
<h3>Step 12: To see the payment details, go to Detail View and move to the Payments tab.</h3>
<h3>Step 13: Here, you&#39;ll see the payment from charge ID 911-3295 and the date of service using which we have adjusted a $200 in discharge ID.</h3>

<h3>Step 1: Familiarize with the dashboard layout. Notice the different sections at the top: overall billing tab, patient collection tab, reports, and the newly added reports section. These provide a comprehensive overview of the clinic and detailed reports.</h3>
<h3>Step 2: Use the filters. Filter data by payer name, PP, tags, patient names, charge ID, claim statuses, or set a date range. For this guide, leave these filters empty.</h3>
<h3>Step 3: Understand the claim buckets. The dashboard displays different buckets where claims can sit. The first one is Draft.</h3>
<h3>Step 4: Explore the Draft section. This is where claims are prepared before submission. Here, view all claims ready for submission, make edits or changes as needed, update the overall status, submit the claim, write it off, or edit it.</h3>
<h3>Step 5: Edit a claim. Clicking on edit takes into the actual claim. Click on the edit button at the top.</h3>
<h3>Step 6: Edit details such as the ICD code or the CPT code. Ensure these are correct before sending them out. Once done, click on done to save changes.</h3>
<h3>Step 7: To save the changes. Click on save.</h3>
<h3>Step 8: Return to the dashboard. Click on Draft again. If desired, submit the claim.</h3>
<h3>Step 9: Understand the Accepted bucket. These are claims that have been accepted by the clearinghouse. Once paid by the insurance payer, they move to the Bill Pending section.</h3>
<h3>Step 10: Understand the bill pending section. This is where the patient responsibility lies. Once the patient pays their portion, closing the claim, it moves to the Close section.</h3>
<h3>Step 11: Understand the paper submission buckets. Some payers require a paper submission. These claims are tracked in the Paper Submission and Paper Submitted sections.</h3>
<h3>Step 12: Understand the Rejected bucket. These are claims that have been rejected by the clearinghouse. The reasons for rejection are provided for review and correction before resubmission.</h3>
<h3>Step 13: Understand the Pending Review section. This is where claims with partial payments are reviewed to ensure full payment.</h3>
<h3>Step 14: Understand the Denied section. These are claims denied by the payer, not the clearinghouse. The reasons for denial are provided.</h3>
<h3>Step 15: Edit a denied claim. Make necessary changes and resubmit the claim.</h3>
<h3>Step 16: Understand the Self Pay bucket. This is where all self pay claims are tracked.</h3>
<h3>Step 17: Export data. All data can be exported for further analysis or record-keeping.</h3>

<h3>Step 5: In the secondary claims, you&#39;ll find the option to submit a new fresh claim. Once you submit a fresh claim, the resubmit option will appear under the same menu. This applies to tertiary claims as well.</h3>
<h3>Step 6: The same option is available in the Denied and Bill Pending buckets.</h3>
<p>Please note, if the claim is self-pay,

"Missed Copay Feature","missed-copay-feature","Guide for Missed Copay Feature","<p><video controls src=""/videos/missed-copay-feature.mp4"" style=""width: 100%""></video></p>
<p>This guide explains how to use the &quot;Missed Copay&quot; feature in the Billing tab and the significance of the red and green dollar icons on the scheduler. The scheduler displays two appointments for the therapist, Megan Young. The patient, Ross Helms, has a red dollar sign next to his appointment.
This red dollar sign indicates that the copay has been entered in the total copay field, but it hasn&#39;t been collected yet.
On the other hand, the patient, Courtney Butler, has a green dollar sign next to her appointment.
This green dollar sign signifies that the copay has been collected.
For instance, Courtney&#39;s copay is twenty dollars, and the collected amount is also twenty dollars. Hence, a collected copay is represented by a green dollar sign.
Now, let&#39;s consider a scenario where a patient has a copay of thirty dollars, but it was missed during collection.
To rectify this, navigate to the patient&#39;s timeline.
Then, proceed to the Billing tab.
Here, we&#39;ve added a &quot;Missed Copay&quot; feature. It shows a missed copay amount of thirty dollars that needs to be collected from the patient. To collect this payment,
click on &quot;Collect Payments&quot;. If there are multiple missed copays, select the relevant charge IDs. All copays will be listed in the columns. After selecting the charge IDs for which payment needs to be collected, click on
&quot;Collect Payment&quot;. This allows you to collect the payment from the patient using different payment methods. After choosing the payment method, click on the &quot;Collect Payment&quot; option.
If you need to send an invoice to the patient for the missed copay, there&#39;s an option in the total outstanding balance called &quot;Collect Payments&quot;.
Click on it. The missed copay invoice will appear on the left screen panel. To send the invoice to the patient, click
on &quot;List Copay List&quot;.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Utilize the Custom Instructions feature.</h3>
<p>Here, you&#39;re able to add your own guidance beyond presets, allowing Scribe to document in specific scenarios. This feature empowers you to personalize your notes to suit your practice style.</p>
<h3>Step 5: Enable or disable the Review window using a simple checkbox.</h3>
<p>When enabled, every output will first go to a review screen before entering your note, providing you with full control and peace of mind.</p>
<h3>Step 6: Once settings are saved, proceed to use Scribe. For this demonstration, we&#39;ll select Quick Dictation.</h3>
<p>You&#39;re not limited to using a predefined transcription, you&#39;re also able to record live with your patient. During recording, you have the ability to pause,
navigate to different SOAP sections,
or add extra instructions at any time.</p>
<h3>Step 7: After finishing, click Generate Review.</h3>
<p>Scribe will process the transcript and open the review window. Here, you have the option to select or
deselect sections you want
applied,
edit values directly if needed,
and view extra
notes that Scribe couldn&#39;t map into fields, ensuring nothing is lost. </p>
<h3>Step 8: Once satisfied, click Push to SOAP.</h3>
<p>Your selected content will instantly fill into your notes.
For future use, you have the option to build on
an existing Transcript
or refine it to further enhance outputs, or
start a fresh new one.
That&#39;s it! With these improvements, Scribe offers smoother navigation, personalized settings, and a review-first process, giving you complete control over your documentation.</p>
