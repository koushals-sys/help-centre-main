In this article, you'll learn how to use the Bulk Add Tag feature to update tags for multiple charge IDs at once.

### Step 1: Navigate to the Billing tab.

### Step 2: Under the Billing Dashboard, you'll find the option to update tags for one or multiple charge IDs simultaneously.

### Step 3: Select more than one charge ID. Once you do this, the Bulk Add Tag button will appear.

### Step 4: Click on the Bulk Add Tag button. Here, you're allowed to select one or multiple tags at the same time.

### Step 5: After selecting the tags, click on Save to apply them.

### Step 6: The tags are now updated for the selected charge IDs. You'll see the status displayed.

### Step 7: If you wish to update all charge IDs on the Billing Dashboard, simply select all charge IDs by clicking the check button. The Bulk Add Tags button will appear.

Note: If you've already added any tags and try to apply them again, they won't be duplicated.

### Step 8: If you need to stop the operation midway, click on the Cancel button. This will halt the action and display which charge IDs have been successfully updated and which have failed.

That's it! You've now mastered the Bulk Add Tag feature.
