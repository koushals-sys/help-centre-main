to the module creation page, where you can start building a new module for your client. You’ll review
the available input fields, making sure you understand each option before proceeding. Next, you enter
information into the description field—if you’re unsure what to include, you can always refer to previous modules for inspiration. You scroll
down to the media upload section, where you can add helpful resources or skip this step if not needed. Finally, you prepare
to save the exercise, ensuring all details are correct before completing the process.By following these steps, you’ll be able to confidently create and manage client programs in your dashboard, helping you deliver a seamless experience for your clients every time.
