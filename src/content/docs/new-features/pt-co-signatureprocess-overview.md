How to send note for co signature. After completing the SOAP note, you will have the option need co signature. If a therapist needs a co signature, they can activate this feature by clicking on
this checkbox. A list of therapists will then appear. From this list, they can choose the therapist to whom they want to send the note for approval. Right now, we've chosen a specific therapist and sent the note for approval. Once you've sent the note for approval, the respective therapist can review it from their
dashboard. They can either send it for revision or complete the note. Thank you.
