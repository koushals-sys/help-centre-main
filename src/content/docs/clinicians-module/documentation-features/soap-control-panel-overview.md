This guide provides a walkthrough on how to use the Soap Control Panel. This tool allows users to view and modify parameters of a soap node, which in turn fetches the corresponding template.Begin by opening the Soap Control Panel. 

### Step 1: Click on the header to open the Soap Control Panel.
This reveals all the parameters based on which the soap node and template are fetched.

### Step 2: Observe the template name. This is determined by the selected parameters.
The parameters include case insurance, cardinal case insurance card, apartment type, and note type.
To modify a parameter:

### Step 3: Select the parameter to change. For instance, if the insurance card is not matching, change the insurance card.

### Step 4: Apply the changes. The new template will then be fetched based on the updated parameters.

The parameters of a specific sub-node of the node type can also be altered.

### Step 5: Change the parameters of the sub-node.

### Step 6: Hit apply to implement the changes.

The node will now reflect the updated parameters. For example, it may change to a progress node.
