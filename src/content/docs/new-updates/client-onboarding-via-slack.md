This article will guide you through the process of using Slack for seamless client onboarding and efficient query resolution.

### Step 1: Start by understanding the onboarding process. Once a client is onboarded, we create a group and add the clients to a specific Slack channel. This ensures smooth onboarding.

### Step 2: If you have any queries or questions, simply post them on the channel. This way, everyone can assist you with a suitable resolution.

### Step 3: To initiate a conversation, simply say "Hi team, kindly resolve the query." Inform us about your issue and the responsible team will take over and help you with a resolution.

### Step 4: Ensure not to ask another query on the same thread. If another query is asked on the same thread, there's a chance of missing out on the query. Always start a fresh conversation for each new query.

### Step 5: To keep track of your first query and its resolution, check the replies from the team members. This will give you an idea of the progress towards resolving your query. You can raise your second query in the same manner.

### Step 6: Remember, using Slack is simple. Whenever a new conversation is initiated, ensure it's not under any other query's thread. It should always be a new conversation.

### Step 7: Keep in mind that every new query should initiate a new conversation on Slack.
