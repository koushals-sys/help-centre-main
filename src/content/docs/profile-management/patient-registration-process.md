In this article, you'll learn how to register a new patient in the system.

### Step 1: Start by clicking on the Patients tab.

### Step 2: Next, click on Add New Patient.

### Step 3: Now, it's time to enter the mandatory information.

### Step 4: After entering the necessary details, click on Add Patient.

### Step 5: A new window will open where you're allowed to enter the patient's insurance card details, if available.

### Step 6: If the insurance card details are not applicable, simply select Skip.

### Step 7: The system will then direct you to the newly created patient's chart in the Personal Details page. Here, you're free to enter any additional information you prefer. If you don't have all the details at the moment, don't worry. The patient will also receive this form on their side during intake, so it's not mandatory for the clinic to fill out this form during registration.
